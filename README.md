# Predictive Model

This repository contains a simple web-based tool for predicting a baseball player's batting average.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser and fill in the number of hits, at-bats, and home runs. Click **Predict** to see the calculated batting average.

## Validation

Inputs are validated to ensure all values are numbers and non-negative. If the inputs are invalid, an error message will appear instead of a prediction.
